# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
  
The process is in the [notebook](https://github.com/louispoweichen/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection/blob/master/credit_card_fraud_detection.ipynb)  
The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  

This notebook will test different methods on skewed data. The idea is to compare if preprocessing techniques work better when there is an overwhelming majority class that can disrupt the efficiency of our predictive model.
